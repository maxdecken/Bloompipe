# Bloompipe
Bloompipe is a unique website that allows users to upload their favorite music and receive a personalized music video in return. The platform utilizes advanced audio analysis and neural network technologies to create a truly bespoke experience for each user.

Disclaimer: This GitHub repository only contains a sample for the modules we used as microservices, as the whole code is in a private repository. This sample should give an inside in how I build the APIs for the modules with Phyton and Flask.

## The Project
Bloompipe is a project that was developed during my bachelor studies at HTW-Berlin, it was done during my project semester together with 7 other students, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Kai-Uwe Barthel and Konstantin Schall

## My Contribution
I was part of the team responsible for designing the software architecture of the web-app, which was based on a micro-service architecture, and designing the REST-API. I also developed the micro-service module responsible for postprocessing and worked collaboratively with the rest of the team on building the web app.

## Tech-Stack
- Python (with Flask for REST-Api)
- Docker
- Node.js
